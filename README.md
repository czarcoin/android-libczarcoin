# android-libczarcoin

**Notice: Development on android-libstorj is currently on pause during our v3 rearchitecture. Please see [storj/storj](https://github.com/storj/storj) for ongoing v3 development.**

Android library for encrypted file transfer on the Storj network via bindings to [libstorj](https://github.com/Storj/libstorj).

The library includes:

* [Java API](https://github.com/Storj/java-libstorj) for working with the Storj network
* Pre-build native libraries: libstorj and all its dependencies (libuv, json-c, curl, openssl, etc.)

## Requirements

* Android 5.0 Lollipop or newer

## Setup

Add the Gradle dependency to the `build.gradle` file of the app module:

```Gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'io.storj:libstorj-android:0.8'
}
```

## Usage

Use the [StorjAndroid](android-libstorj/src/main/java/io/storj/libstorj/android/StorjAndroid.java) factory to get an instance of the [Storj](https://github.com/Storj/java-libstorj/blob/master/src/main/java/io/storj/libstorj/Storj.java) class, properly initialized for Android:

```java
Storj storj = StorjAndroid.getInstance(getContext());
```

Use the public methods of the [Storj](https://github.com/Storj/java-libstorj/blob/master/src/main/java/io/storj/libstorj/Storj.java) class to work with the Storj network.
